0,"Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) had a decent third quarter; $4 billion in net income is quite nice considering the expected uplift stronger oil prices will yield this quarter. One thing that really stuck out this earnings cycle was the commentary on Exxon Mobil Corporation's future capital allocation strategy that investors should really take note of. Capital allocation priorities don't include additional buybacks Exxon spent $496 million during the first nine months of 2017 to buy back six million of its common shares to offset stock-based compensation related dilution. That was overwhelmed by the 96 million shares that were issued over that period to fund its purchase of several Permian Basin companies from the Bass family, and its acquisition of InterOil. This is why the number of outstanding XOM shares rose from 4.148 billion at the end of last year to 4.237 billion at the end of Q3 2017. In Exxon's earnings press release, it noted that ""the corporation will continue to acquire shares to offset dilution in conjunction with its benefit plans and programs, but does not currently plan on making purchases to reduce shares outstanding."" Usually Exxon Mobil completes its anti-dilution buybacks in the first quarter of the year. During the conference call management commented: ""ExxonMobil did not make any share repurchases to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs [during Q3], and we don't currently plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding in the fourth quarter."" When pressed on the broader buyback issue during the Q&A session, management made it clear that beyond the current anti-dilution program, share buybacks aren't high on the agenda for Exxon:    ""[T]he way we think about it from our sources of funds, the first things that are being funded are our dividends and our investment program. And if there's any cash left at that point given that the corporation does not want to hold large cash reserves, it's at that point that we will look for what the next best thing is. And maybe if we have some debt maturing, we'll pay that debt down. But on a quarterly basis, we'll make a decision on whether we go ahead and buy back some shares."" 
 It appears Exxon Mobil wants to first obtain a consistent and sustainable cash flow position before deciding what to do with excess cash generation. Covering its dividend and capex is a top priority as those are organic, ongoing requirements. After that, debt reduction and having a nice cash balance is Exxon's second priority. Buybacks appear to be third on that list, and that is a reasonable capital allocation strategy. Share buybacks are only justified when doing so with free cash flow, particularly when there is already debt on the books. Taking on debt (or burning through cash) to buy back common stock, short of those shares sporting an abnormally high dividend yield, is (in my humble opinion) a terrible idea. Especially in an industry as volatile as the oil & gas space. Exxon is aware that having a large debt load creates a major overhang on its stock price, and eats into its bottom line. The company spent $1.4 billion on debt reduction and financing related activities in Q3, which pushed its total debt load down by $1.3 billion (versus the end of Q2) to $40.6 billion. The rest was presumably used up by other financing and debt retirement costs. Gauging the cash flow situation Factoring out a working capital build of $1.4 billion (due primarily to Hurricane Harvey, which created a $1 billion build), $0.9 billion in asset sale proceeds, and its $1.4 billion in debt reduction/other financing activities, Exxon Mobil generated $8.9 billion in organic cash flow ($4 billion in net income plus $4.9 billion in non-cash depreciation expenses) versus $3.3 billion in dividend payments and just under $6 billion in capex last quarter. That capex includes the acquisition of Jurong Aromatics, which saw Exxon's non-US chemicals capex go from $100-150 million on a quarterly basis up to $1.8 billion in Q3 (deal closed in August). Investors should keep in mind that the $2.8 billion Mozambique acquisition should close this quarter, which will be added to Exxon's international upstream capex. Exxon is buying into the massive gas discoveries in the offshore Area 4 block that in theory should be able to support a massive onshore LNG exporting complex.
 Exxon aims to spend $22 billion on capex in 2017 and so far (Q1-Q3) has spent just under $14.2 billion. The Area 4 purchase, rising unconventional spending, and deals in Brazil will push Exxon's quarterly capex spend up this quarter, possibly up to $8 billion, but there is room for management to push capex slightly below guidance to conserve cash (a decision that will be based on where oil prices go). In the near-term, Exxon should gain immensely from rising Brent and WTI prices, with higher Brent pricing providing an uplift to LNG prices as well (for both spot prices and LNG sales under long-term contracts). Whether or not that will be enough to push Exxon's cash flow generation high enough to cover an elevated Q4 capex level remains to be seen. Improving Alaska North Slope prices, which closely tracks Brent, will be a major boon for its oil-heavy Alaskan production streams. Assuming Brent/ANS average $60 and WTI $55 in 2018 (versus $52 Brent and $48 WTI in Q3 2017), the uplift should be enough to enable Exxon to at least reach cash flow neutrality. If the company keeps a lid on its capex budget, then free cash flow generation is possible. Debt reduction, controlled spending habits, better upstream realizations (oil, natural gas liquids, and liquefied natural gas) due to a better Brent pricing environment, and building out its downstream division (particularly on the Chemicals side, both domestically and internationally) are the three main ways Exxon hopes to grow its cash flow generation through 2020. Its upstream production base is forecasted to stay flat at 4-4.4 million BOE/d over that time frame, but investors should note that Exxon's output slipped to 3.878 million BOE/d in Q3. That is a risk that needs to be monitored. Exxon has been growing its Permian footprint through both acreage acquisitions (Tier 1-2), midstream investments (buying an oil terminal at Wink, TX, and its stake in the recently formed Permian Express Partners), and a rising upstream production base. That will help offset declines from mature fields elsewhere, but it has been an uphill climb so far.
 Rising liquefied natural gas exports out of the Gorgon LNG venture in Australia and (potentially) growth from its Bakken/Three-Forks operations in North Dakota will push Exxon's output closer to the bottom end of its guidance. Longer term, several major oil discoveries in Guyana, exploration and appraisal efforts in Brazil's Campos Basin, and optimization and delineation efforts at Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale play will help Exxon manage its upstream production base. On a side note, Hurricane Harvey negatively impacted Exxon's bottom line by $160 million last quarter. While hurricane activity led to a sharp increase in refining margins for many operators, upstream shut-ins, repair costs, and a hit to Exxon's domestic Chemicals unit hurt its financial performance. The restart and ramp-up of its Gulf of Mexico operations should behoove Exxon this quarter, or at least mitigate the impact of refining margins coming back down. Final thoughts Exxon Mobil Corporation is making the right call by reducing its debt burden and waiting for more certainty on oil prices before deciding how it wants to reward shareholders. In the event Brent holds above $60 for a long time, Exxon Mobil Corporation can either increase its dividend, pay down debt, invest more in growth projects in a bid to boost earnings, and/or buyback shares to reward investors. However, Exxon Mobil Corporation has to manage those uses of cash within the realities of its ""limited"" cash flow generation compared to the boom days of $100+ WTI/Brent. As of now, covering organic uses of cash and ensuring its dividend can be maintained in perpetuity is a top priority, followed by debt reduction which frees up cash flow by reducing its interest expenses. Share buybacks will have to wait. To read more about Exxon Mobil Corporation check out its Permian growth story by clicking here.

1,"Exxon Mobil (XOM), the world's biggest integrated oil and gas company, has shown its ability to withstand depressed oil prices and is now well positioned to boost its profitability. While earnings bottomed in 2016, XOM has been able to reduce its debt and increase dividends in 2017, as well as slightly reducing capital expenditures. Production growth should follow because the company allocated 50% of its CapEx to shale and offshore development. Furthermore, the refining and marketing branches' merger reveals that the company is pursuing cost rationalization and will likely contribute to XOM's earnings growth after its completion in 1Q2018. XOM's current valuation metrics are higher than those of its peers, yet, the ""you get what you pay for"" notion perfectly applies here. From a technical standpoint, the stock has been recovering since the end of August, when it reached a low of $76. A strong acceleration followed, propelling prices much higher towards a strong resistance level at $84. On October 27, 3Q2017 results were evenly welcomed, but did not produce sufficient upward pressure to overcome the previous top. However, I am of the view that once the $84 level is cleared, XOM should go in a straight line towards the next crucial resistance at $95. 


 Source: Trading View Top line and net earnings steadily on the rise XOM reported a mitigated report for 3Q2017, with an increase of 50% year on year in net earnings. The increase should be taken cautiously due to the low base effect. Indeed, last year was one of the toughest for the company, given the slump in oil prices to a low of $26. Therefore, the bottom line was widely impacted and contributed inevitably to the worst performance in the last five years. 

 Source: Company's 3Q2017 report That said, the company has now resumed its growth path, with top-line revenue up 4% quarter on quarter and costs down (on average 3% quarter-on-quarter). These elements combined with the improving oil backdrop (see my previous article on oil) will consistently boost earnings. The integrated company is already on this growth path and is approaching ""pas-à-pas"" 2015 performance, establishing year-to-date bottom-line results of $3.77B. 

 Source: Company's 2016 Annual Report Strong downstream, ramping upstream, but mixed chemical results Improving results are driven by better upstream developments, rising downstream margins, but are undermined somewhat by sluggish chemical performance. Upstream division earnings was up by $947m year-on-year to $1.567B in the 3Q2017 and 32.3% quarter-on-quarter, principally due to strong results outside the US more than counterbalancing shrinking homeland earnings (-$238M quarter-on-quarter).
 Chemical division totaled $1.092B, slightly down from a year ago, on lower commodity margins and hurricane Harvey impacts. However, the mitigated performance was partly offset by volume growth, up 11% compared to previous quarter, and future prospects, namely the completion of the aromatics plant acquisition in Singapore, which will bring total production capacity to 3.5M metric tons per year. The company will benefit from its strategic position to cope with the growing Asian demand. Moreover, the chemical division profitability is expected to improve, as XOM's refining and marketing divisions complete their merger in 1Q2018. On the opposite site, downstream is a top performer, with volumes up $147m quarter-on-quarter to $1.532B in 3Q2017 (up by $147M) and improving profit margins to a high of 14%, although other items negatively impacted earnings by $550M, mainly due to higher one-off costs related to hurricane Harvey. Overall petroleum sales and oil equivalent production are slowing, down 32k b/d to 11.084M b/d and 44koe b/d to 3878Moe b/d, respectively. 

 Source: Company's 3Q2017 report Flat petroleum sales and production, but still a ""cash cow"" Although the company continues to struggle to grow petroleum sales and production, which may be a cause of investor disappointment, XOM's financial situation is well grounded. The company reported dividend distributions of $3.289B and capital expenditures of $5.987B in 3Q2017. Not only did XOM manage to sustain the latter, but it also reduced total long-term debt by $1.3B and ended the quarter with a net cash position of $4.3B, in excess of $300M compared to the previous month. This was attributable to rising net cash provided by operation activities (up 9% from 2Q2017), which amounted to $8.4B, including asset sales proceeds and robust working capital results.
 Thus, XOM is still a ""cash cow,"" and further upside is likely after the Senate approved the tax reduction plan. Moreover, the company's financial flexibility should allow it to further reduce its debt level of $40.6B and lift its dividend distribution and/or external growth. Valuation In terms of 2017e EV/EBITDA, the major oil and gas company is better valued compared to its peers with an implied ratio of 9.14x versus an average of 7.01x. However, the company has the lowest leverage ratio, at 0.88x, and a dividend yield close to its American peer, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). Against this, I expect a rerating for all major US oil and gas companies due to stronger oil prices and a positive tax reform effect. In this vein, I believe that XOM is likely to reach an implied 2018 P/E of 22x, in line with its closest peer, CVX. This means a target price of $95, which is the level at which the company traded in 2015, providing an upside of 14%.

source: Stock Photo Exxon Mobil (XOM) has always been considered a safe holding during difficult economic times, and a weaker holding once the economy and energy market rebound. That's no different this year as the price of oil has jumped significantly in 2017 and the economy continues to grow at a healthy pace, while Exxon lags the performance of its peers. Major competitors like Shell and Chevron have moved up nicely in 2017, with Chevron recently climbing to a three-year high of a little over $126.00 per share as I write, and Shell having soared to $66.40 per share, a robust gain of roughly 22.5 percent on the year, a 52-week high. During that same time Exxon has lost about 7.5 percent, lagging the sector throughout the year.  This shouldn't be surprising to most investors, as that has been the usual performance of Exxon over time and why it does best for those investors holding it for the long term, as it averages out pretty well. It's also why it's a dividend aristocrat, having increased dividends for 34 years in a row.  Even so, Exxon does need to shrink the differentiation between itself and its competitors, and its merger of two divisions and benefit from tax reform should be solid catalysts going forward. Merger of divisions The downstream businesses of Exxon have been the key reason it does well during slow times for the industry, as it offsets much of the decline in oil and gas prices. It also weighs on the company during periods of growth, causing Exxon to usually underperform against its peers.
 To mitigate some of that, CEO Darren Woods decided to merge its Exxon Mobil Refining and Supply Company and Exxon Mobil Fuels, Lubricants & Specialties Marketing Company, into a new unit called Exxon Mobil Fuels & Lubricants Company. The overall purpose is to generate more cash flow from its downstream business in order to offset the more volatile performance of its upstream business. Among the major challenges associated with its upstream business is exposure to low-priced natural gas and high-cost offshore assets, along with it 58 percent of its output coming from liquids, against the 60 percent that Shell and Chevron enjoy - it isn't getting the same benefit from higher oil prices than its peers are getting. Production also was down in the first nine months, averaging a little under 4,000 barrel oil equivalent per day, a decline of 1.2 percent year-over-year. As for offshore drilling, the company is currently heavily exposed to it, and that has dragged some on its cash flow because of higher costs. On a positive note, it can ramp up investment in its growing, lower-cost shale assets, and that should boost the upstream over the next few years, once that is in play.  Finally, the price of natural gas have been selling at below $3.00 per MMBtu, and with Exxon being the second-largest U.S. producer, it also adds to the volatility of its upstream performance. The move to merge the two downstream divisions tells me the company will take time to work through its upstream challenges. That will help increase cash flow while the company increases its shale operations, while waiting for the price of natural gas to climb to more favorable levels. Tax benefits Although the signing into law of the tax reform bill in the U.S. will benefit all companies, it will disproportionately have a positive impact on Exxon Mobil because it's known to be one of the heavily taxed corporations in the country. It has been paying out over 40 percent in taxes. Under the new U.S. tax laws for corporations, it will plunge to 21 percent.
 The major initial benefit for Exxon is it should significantly increase its bottom line, allowing it to allocate capital in a variety of ways that benefit shareholders and the company. This is important when considering the competitive environment, as it's giving Exxon a larger windfall than its competitors, and that will be on an ongoing basis. It could be a major game changer depending upon how the company uses the extra capital. Conclusion When combined with the merger of its two downstream divisions, the tax benefits coming from a much lower base should be a couple of very positive catalysts for Exxon. As it eventually gets a better product mix in its upstream business, it should change the performance of the company to one that is less volatile under all economic environments. It will also continue to discover and replace declining reserves to maintain its production growth in the years ahead.  Taxes and the merger of downstream divisions will have an immediate impact on the company starting in the first quarter of 2018, while the expected changes in its upstream business will be more of a long-term project.  Taken together, these should improve the growth aspect of Exxon's business, but I still see it as being a stock that should be held for the long term to get the best average performance out of it over the long haul.

3,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) looks to be on the verge of breaking out higher as its operating environment improves. Although XOM has fallen nearly 20% since 2014, its share price now looks to be stabilizing. Rising energy prices are aiding the company's share price, improving management's outlook. With commodity stocks being traditionally volatile, using a low risk option position could be the best way to gain long exposure. Price Action XOM is setting up technically very well, reversing its multi-year downtrend. The chart below highlights both XOM's daily and weekly time-frames. The oil price collapse of 2014-2016 weighed on XOM's revenue growth, and thus drastically damaged investor sentiment around the sector. Although XOM maintained a strong balance sheet and steady dividend payout throughout the oil price meltdown, its share price experienced sharp declines. Now however, as commodity prices are stabling over the last year, XOM's share price looks to be on the verge of an upside breakout. Since September, XOM has traded in a tight range between 80 and 83. With the energy sector experiencing broad strength in recent weeks, it is likely XOM will soon follow higher. Based on the stock's volatility profile, if its share price does breakout to the upside, investor optimism could carry XOM into the low- to mid-90s range over the next year. 

 Source: Trading View Fundamental Narrative Rising energy prices are aiding the company's top-line growth, while lower capex guidance could free up cash flow in coming years. In its most recent quarter, XOM's upstream earnings came in at an impressive $1.6 billion, an increase of nearly $950 million from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher realizations, according to management. This was largely tied to crude prices rising nearly $6.50 per barrel versus the year-ago quarter, while its gas realizations increased about $0.60 per thousand cubic feet.
 Moreover, volume and mix effects increased earnings by $20 million. Upstream unit profitability for the quarter was $4.53 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. XOM's upstream unit is largely dependent on rising energy prices to fuel margin growth. Management was bullish on the price of oil during the call, with the commodity putting together impressive price action. Below is both a daily and weekly chart of WTI crude. After collapsing from 2014-2016, the commodity has formed a nice bottoming pattern, with an upside breakout in recent weeks. With global oil prices in the $60 range currently, profit margins should expand, leading XOM to likely show impressive earnings growth in quarters to come. 

 Source: Trading View Additionally, management is also committed to reducing its capital expenditures, which should benefit cash flows going forward. According to management, its year-to-date expenditures on capex is trending lower with guidance at $22 billion. Management also added some specifics about its capex projections on the call: ""You may recall that our objective is to go ahead and close the transaction for the Mozambique Area 4 acreage before year end, and that's still the plan, and that was about $2.8 billion."" And ""At the same time, we have also ramped up some activity in our unconventional business. And, of course, we've got the Brazil transactions that we just consummated. And all of that really leads us to the view that the guidance is appropriate."" Below is a chart of both XOM's capex to revenue, as well as its free cash flow. XOM has made an effort to reduce its relative expenditure on capex in recent years relative to overall revenue, but has plans to further cut back. Capex to revenue has fallen from nearly 10% on a trailing twelve month basis in 2015, to now just below 6%. Declining expenses, on top of rising revenue due to potentially higher energy prices, should drive cash flow higher, benefiting shareholders.
 

  The Trade Although XOM is a large and established company, it is still beholden to the price of oil. This volatility makes using a call option to gain long exposure to the stock attractive. The option I am looking at is the July 2018 85 call trading at $2.80. This indicates that you gain exposure to potentially $8500 of XOM stock with the small initial premium of $280. Leverage is inherent in the option, increasing the return on investment relative to holding 100 shares of the underlying stock. Moreover, losses are limited to the initial premium paid for the call option. Remember however, that full loss of principle is possible in options trading, so weight the position appropriately. 

 Source: Think or Swim Conclusion XOM is an attractive investment at current levels as its share price has steadied amid rising energy prices. After years of decline, XOM's price reversal higher makes it an interesting value stock. Moreover, management is bullish on the company's operating environment, while also looking to cut capex to increase cash flows. With XOM being a commodity-dependent stock, using a call option to gain long exposure makes a lot of sense. The option has a leveraged upside, alongside a hedge downside.
